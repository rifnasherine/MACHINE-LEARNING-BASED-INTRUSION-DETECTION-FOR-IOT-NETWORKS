## Machine Learning-Based Intrusion Detection for IOT Networks
The Machine Learning–Based Intrusion Detection for IoT Networks project focuses on enhancing the security of Internet of Things (IoT) environments by intelligently detecting and classifying cyberattacks using machine learning techniques. The system aims to identify malicious network activities such as Denial of Service (DoS), Port Scanning, and Malware attacks, thereby improving the reliability and trustworthiness of IoT networks.

## About
Machine Learning–Based Intrusion Detection for IoT Networks is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional rule-based security systems, which struggle to detect evolving and zero-day cyber threats. IoT networks generate massive volumes of heterogeneous traffic, making manual monitoring impractical.

This project leverages supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to analyze network traffic patterns and detect anomalies in IoT communication. By learning from historical data, the system can accurately differentiate between normal and malicious behavior, offering a scalable and adaptive solution for securing resource-constrained IoT environments.
